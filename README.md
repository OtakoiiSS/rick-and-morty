# Rick and Morty project
The essence of this project is to create a web application that retrieves information about all the characters from the Rick and Morty TV series through an API. The application allows users to view the main page with all the characters and obtain more detailed information about each character by clicking on their icon. A search function has also been implemented to enable users to find specific characters. An important aspect of the project is to ensure that the search and character filtering data is saved even after the page is reloaded or the user navigates to a different route.

# The following libraries were used:
React, react-router, Axios, uuid

# Note
It should be noted that due to the small size of the project, Redux was not utilized, and the logic for saving data even after reloading the page was implemented using local storage.
